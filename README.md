# Timeline App

## Stage 1: Static Skeleton

This is the first stage of the Timeline App project.

### Features Included:
- A semantic HTML structure to organize the timeline application.
- A `<header>` containing the app logo and a theme toggle button.
- An empty `<nav>` element reserved for future filters or controls.
- A `<section id="timeline">` to display event markers on the timeline.
- An empty `<div id="modal">` that will be used for modal pop-ups.
- Semantic tags like `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<figure>` for clean and accessible layout.
